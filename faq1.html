                <ul>
                    <li>As you know, MOD means editing APK files. As a result, the MOD APK files
                        will not match the version available on the Google Play Store.
                    </li>
                    <li>That's why Play Protect now warns you every time you want to install MOD
                        APK.
                    </li>
                    <li>So the best way is to "turn off Play Protect" completely and never mind it
                        if you want to install and use the MOD APK.

                    <li>Each App/Software/Tool version has a different installation method. So on
                        the download page of each version, we have specific installation
                        instructions.
