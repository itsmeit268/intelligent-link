                <ul>
                    <li>As you know, MOD means editing APK files. As a result, the MOD APK files
                        will not match the version available on the Google Play Store.
                    </li>
                    <li>That's why Play Protect now warns you every time you want to install MOD
                        APK.
                    </li>
                    <li>So the best way is to "turn off Play Protect" completely and never mind it
                        if you want to install and use the MOD APK.
                    </li>
                    <li>The crack/repack version of the software has been modified to omit the license key.
                        As a result, some antivirus programs like Windows Defender may flag it as a potential threat and delete it.
                        To prevent this, you can disable the automatic scanning feature of your antivirus program before installing the application or tool.
