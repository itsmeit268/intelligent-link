                <ul>
                    <li>You can use the Windows software uninstall feature or some software like
                        [<a href="/how-to-completely-remove-an-app-from-windows-11-10.html">link</a>].
                        If you are worried about security, you can use an anti-virus program to remove cracked/repack software from your computer.

                        the need to enter it. Alternatively, you can purchase and download the application/software
                        directly from the software developer.
